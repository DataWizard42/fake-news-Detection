# Fake News Detection

## Overview

This repository contains code for building a simple fake news detection model using machine learning. The model uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier and TF-IDF vectorization for text data.

## Prerequisites

- Python (>=3.6)
- Required libraries: pandas, scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vaibhav143-cherry/fake-news-Detection

Install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Dataset:

Place your dataset file (e.g., fake_news_data.csv) in the root directory.

Data Preprocessing:

Open the Jupyter Notebook or run the Python script.
Ensure the dataset file name matches the one in the script.
Run the Code:

Execute the code in the notebook or script to train the fake news detection model.

Evaluate the Model:

Check the accuracy and classification report printed in the console.

Customization
Feel free to customize the code according to your requirements. Some potential areas for improvement include:

Trying different machine learning models (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Random Forests).
Experimenting with different text preprocessing techniques.
Using pre-trained word embeddings or language models for more advanced feature representations.
